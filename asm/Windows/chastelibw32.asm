;this function converts a string pointed to by eax into an integer returned in eax instead
;it is a little complicated because it has to account for whether the character in
;a string is a decimal digit 0 to 9, or an alphabet character for bases higher than ten
;it also checks for both uppercase and lowercase letters for bases 11 to 36
;finally, it checks if that letter makes sense for the base.
;For example, G to Z cannot be used in hexadecimal, only A to F can
